A StackPath **workload** represents the collection of resources needed to deliver an application.  A workload's type can be either **virtual machine** (*VM*) or **container**, and the workload itself is composed of instances of one of these types.  Workloads are deployed to one or more of StackPath's **edge locations** (points of presence, or **PoPs**).  Virtual machines are built using an operating system image. Containers are built using a Docker image pulled from a registry such as DockerHub or other service.

A given workload can have one or more instances deployed at each PoP, all built using the same image.  In order to handle spikes in load, auto-scaling features are supported, whereby StackPath will monitor CPU utilization within the instances of a workload, and will deploy additional instances when certain criteria are met in order to reduce the load on each instance.  When StackPath detects that load for all instances has dropped low enough to meet the auto-scaling criteria, instances will be removed from the workload automatically.

At deployment, each instance is given a root volume whose size is defined by the image.  If additional storage is needed, a persistent volume may be attached to each virtual machine or container in a workload.  This is particularly useful for workloads using container instances, for which the root volume does **not** persist.

Every instance in a workload gets a private and public IP address upon creation.  [Network policies](stackpack-network-policies.md) control access to the instances in a workload.  For more complex deployments, an **Anycast IP address** can be added at the time of creation of the workload, and will remain assigned to the workload for the duration of its lifetime.  Anycast IP addresses are a feature of StackPath and provide optimal routing for traffic, essentially behaving as a global load balancer for your workload.  <!-- Need to show where Anycast IPs send traffic.  This is not clear to me at this time. -->
